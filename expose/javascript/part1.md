# CSE110 Lab 4 Part 1
1. values added:  20
2. final result: 20
3. values added:  20
4. The code returns an error because since we use the keyword "let" it only allows to be accessed within the block that it's defined in therefore when we acess "result" in the else statement it returns the error.
5. Line 9 it returns an error since we declared const as "const" this means that it cannot be changed and thus when we tried to reassign it causes an error. 
6. On line 13 it also returns an error because we are accessing result out of the if statement since "const" similar to let that only allows to be accessed within the block that it's been defined it. 
7.
